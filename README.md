Here is the code for my webscraping mini project. I decided to go to Thinkgeek, an awesome geeky nerdy merchandise website that has super cool stuffs that drain my wallet. Ironically, I decided to keep track of this product http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/khol/. That's right, The official cookbook based on The Walking Dead. Because who doesn't want to know Carol's secret cookie recipe? (applesauce is her secret ingredient wink wink). 
For the code, I'm keeping track of the availability status, whether it's still "In Stock" or not. Because who knows, one day I might decide to buy this book unironically and I'd need to know if the book's still available.

Enough blah blah, here's the instruction on how to install it
1. Install Beautifulsoup via pip:

- easy_install pip  
- pip install beautifulsoup4

2. Install the Requests library

- pip install requests

3. Download and run the TWD4.py

4. A status read "In Stock" or otherwise and the date and time should appear on the screen

5. I also made the results print out as a text file so that you can see the comparison. Search for an "out.txt" file on your computer and you should see the availibility status and the date printed on simple notepad file.
